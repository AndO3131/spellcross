# Spellcross unpackers

* `unfs.py` -- for `FS` (not `FSU`) archives
* `unlz.py` -- for `LZ` and `LZ0` files
* `mkimg.py` -- merge raw image data + `PAL` files into `PNG`

`LZ` was reverse-engineered with the aid of
[the LZW compressor by Stanislav Mašláň](http://www.spellcross.kvalitne.cz/spell_lz/spell_mklz.html)

## Aim of the project

* To have fun digging in the data files.
* To document their format publicly in the form of Python code.
